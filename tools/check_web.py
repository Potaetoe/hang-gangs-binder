Check that apps/web is internally consistent and safe to publish.

    python tools/check_web.py

Derived from what is actually in the directory rather than from a
hand-maintained list, because a hand-maintained list only knows about
files somebody remembered to add to it.

Three checks:

1. Every local href/src in the HTML resolves to a file that exists. A
   rename that misses one reference publishes a page that 404s its own
   stylesheet and renders a dead form.

2. Nothing in apps/web looks like a private key. This is the one that
   matters. The whole design rests on the private key never being
   published, and apps/web is copied verbatim to a public site - so the
   moment a key lands in that directory it is public, permanently, in
   the git history as well as on the web. A regex is a weak guard, but
   it catches the realistic accident: pasting a key into config.js "just
   to test the export locally" and forgetting.

3. Every page carries the shared head: charset, viewport, title, the
   content security policy, the stylesheet and the pre-paint theme
   script. The pages still to be written - admin.html and the form -
   are the ones that handle plaintext and keys, so "I copied the old
   page and trimmed the head" is exactly the mistake worth catching
   automatically rather than at review.

4. The endpoint in config.js is permitted by every page's CSP. These
   are two files that must agree, and they fail apart silently: change
   the endpoint alone and the pages still load, still look right, and
   drop every submission at the connect-src check. Whoever inherits
   this project and points it at their own Worker will change the
   obvious file and not the other one - so the build says so instead of
   the site failing quietly on their first real submitter.
